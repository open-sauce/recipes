# storing

This chutney will not last if you keep it in the refridgerator!!!

The best way to store this chutney is to pour the blender
contents into an ice tray and place in freezer. After
frozen, you can pop them out of the ice tray into a plastic
bag and continue to freeze them.

Whenever you need to break them out, you can grab a few
"ice chutneys" and just microwave it for 5 seconds with
a few drops of water. This allows you to keep the bulk of
your chutney preserved in the freezer.
